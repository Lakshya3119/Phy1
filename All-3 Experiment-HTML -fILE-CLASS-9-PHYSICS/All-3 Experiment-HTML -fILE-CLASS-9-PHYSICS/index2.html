 		<h3>Aim :</h3>
 		<p>To establish the relation between the loss in weight of a solid when fully immersed in<br>
       <b>1.</b>tap water
       <b>2.</b>strongly salty water, with the weight of water displaced by it by taking at least two different solids.

 	<div class="Theory">
 		<h3>Theory :</h3>
 		<p>
 		<b>1. Fluids:Gases and liquids flow and are thus called fluids</b><br>
 	    <b>2.</b>
         Buoyancy:The upward force exerted by fluids on any body is called the buoyant force and this phenomenon is known as buoyancy.<br>
        <b>3.Thrust:</b>The force acting on a body perpendicular to its surface is called thrust. S.I. unit is Newton<br>
        <b>4.Pressure</b>The thrust per unit area is called pressure<br>
        Pressure = Thrust/Area <br>
        S.I. Unit = N/m2 or Nm-2.This is called <b>"Pascal"</b><br>
        <b>5.Weight of a body :</b>5.Mass x acceleration due to gravity<br>
        W = mg<br>
        <b>6.</b>When a body is immersed in water or liquid, the body displaces some liquid.<br>
        <b>7.</b>The volume of liquid displaced = total volume of the solid.
        <b>8.</b>The mass of liquid displaced can be measured as:<br>
                 Mass of liquid displaced = Volume x Density<br>
                 M = V x D<br>
        <b>9.</b>Weight of liquid displaced = Volume x Density x g (acceleration due to gravity)<br>
                 W = V x D x g<br>
        <b>10.</b>The body loses some weight when immersed in fluid, it can be found as follows:<br>
                  Weight of the body in air =W1<br>
                  Weight of the body when immersed in liquid = W2<br>
        <b>11.</b>Hence loss in weight = W2-W1<br>
                  How much will be this upward force/buoyant force depends on the density of liquid in which it is immersed. The upthrust is<br>more by denser liquids<br>
        <b>12. Archimedes’ Principle:</b>When a body is immersed fully or partially in a fluid, it experiences an upward force that is equal <br>to the weight of the fluid displaced by it.<br><br>

 		<h3>Procedures</h3>
 		<p>
 			<b>A. Find the zero error and least count of spring balance:</b><br>
       <b>1.</b>Take an iron stand and suspend a spring balance to it.<br>
       <b>2.</b>Study the spring balance, its scale and its least count.<br>
       <b>3.</b>Record your observations. If any error, record it as ‘x’ gf<br><br>
      <b>B. Find the weight of solid metal bob in air :</b><br>
      <b>1.</b>Take a metal bob, tie thread to it and suspend on the hook of the spring balance.<br>
      <b>2.</b>Record the weight of the metal bob in air. Let this weight be Wr<br>
      <b>C. Find the weight of the metal bob immersed in tap water and record the apparent loss in weight</b><br>
      <b>1.</b>Take an overflow can, fill it with water such that its water level touches the spout of the overflow can.
      <b>2.</b>Keep an overflow can under the spring balance such that the metal bob gets fully immersed in the water of<br>
        the overflow can.<br>
      <b>3.</b>Keep a beaker whose weight P1 is recorded, at the mouth of the spout of overflow can.<br>
      <b>4.</b>As soon as the metal bob is suspended in water the weight on spring balance scale is recorded. This loss in weight is due to buoyancy (W2).<br>
      <b>5.</b>Collect the water that has overflown in a beaker till the last drop that comes out of the spout<br>
      <b>6.</b>Weigh the beaker with water (P2)<br>
      <b>7.</b>Calculate the weight of the displaced water (P2-P1)<br>
      <b>8.</b>Calculate the loss in weight of the metal bob when immersed in water<br>
      <img src="images/s6.jpg">
    <b>  D. Find the weight of metal bob immersed in salty water and record the apparent loss in weight.</b>

     <b>1.</b>Prepare salty water by taking a 500 mL beaker and adding 300 mL of water in it and dissolving common salt till the saturated solution is obtained.
     <b>2.</b>Take the same metal bob and repeat the steps from 1 to 8 as given in procedure ‘C’
     <b>3.</b>Tabulate your observations.

         1.Zero error in spring balance = (x) = 0 gf.<br>
         2.Least count of the spring balance = 2 gf.<br>

    <div class="Conclusion">
    	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
    	<p>
    		<b>1.</b>Hence it is proved that the weight of the water displaced by the metal bob is approximately equal to the apparent loss of<br>weight of the metal bob in water. Archimedes’ principle is verified.<br>
        <b>2.</b>The weight of water displaced by a given solid when immersed fully in strongly salty water is more than the weight of the<br> water displaced when fully immersed in tap water.<br>

    <div class="Precautions">
    	<h3>Precautions</h3>
    	<p>
    		<b>1.</b>Carefully study the spring balance used for the experiment.<br>
        <b>2.</b>Fill the overflow can above the mark of the spout, allow extra water to overflow through the spout without disturbing it.<br> Use this overflow can for the experiment.<br>
        <b>3.</b>Do not allow the suspended solid mass i.e. metal bob/stone to touch the base and sides of the overflow beaker.<br><br>
