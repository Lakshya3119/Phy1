 		<h3>Aim :</h3>
 		<p>
           To determine the velocity of a pulse propagated through a stretched string/slinky.    
        </p>
 	</div>
 	<div class="Theory">
 		<h3>Theory :</h3>
 		<p>
 		<b>1. Wave</b>A wave is a disturbance that moves through a medium when the particles of the medium set neighbouring particles into<br>motion by transfer of energy.<br>
        <b>2.Slinky:</b>A slinky is a long spring which is flexible and has appreciable elasticity.<br>
        <b>Pulse:</b>A wave produced by a single disturbance in a medium is known as pulse.<br>
        <b>Velocity of pulse =</b>Total Distance Travelled By Pulse/Total Time Taken<br>
      </p>
 	</div>
 	
 	<div class="Materials-Required">
 		<h3>Matierials Required :</h3>
 		<p>
 			<b>1.</b>A slinky with flat wire made up of metal/plastic should be atleast 1 m long<br><b>2.</b> a metre scale<br><b>3.</b> a stop-watch<br><b>4.</b>a marker/ chalk<br><br>
 		</p>

 	<div class="Procedures">
 		<h3>Procedures</h3>
 		<p>
 			<b>1.Mark a point on the floor of a long corridor. Let this point be P.</b><br>
            <img src="images/s9.jpg"><br>
            <b>2.</b>From point P measure the distance of 1 m with the help of metre scale, mark this point as Q.<br>
            <b>3.</b>Allow one student to hold one end of slinky at point P.<br>
            <b>4.</b>Let another student stretch the slinky and bring it at point Q.<br>
            <b>5.</b>Let third student hold the stopwatch.<br>
            <b>6.</b>The student who has stretched the slinky will stretch it beyond point Q and then give a sharp push towards pointQ.<br>
             The push should stop at point Q.<br>
            <b>7.</b>A pulse is produced in the slinky which travels towards the point P and it gets reflected backtowards point Q.<br>
            <b>8.</b>Record the time from push at Q to the pulse travelling towards P and back at Q.<br>
            <b>9.</b>Follow the above procedure 56 times and record your observation<br>
            <b>10.</b>Calculate the velocity of pulse by the formula<br>
            <b>Velocity of pulse =</b>Total Distance Travelled By Pulse/Total Time Taken<br>
            <b>v =</b> 2d/t<br><br>

 	</div>
    <div class="Precautions">
    	<h3>Precautions</h3>
    	<p>
    		<b>1.</b>Slinky used should be of good quality and with even springs coiled all over.<br>
            <b>2.</b>Accurately measure the distance and time.<br>
            <b>3.</b>The push at the end should be forceful to see the pulse and get the reflected wave back.<br>
              The slinky should not have any knot or kink at any point along its length.<br><br>
